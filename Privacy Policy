Invite Tracking:
We offer an Invite Tracking feature that allows you to enhance your guild's management and user onboarding process. If you choose to enable invite tracking, here's what will be saved:

Invite Details: We will save information about the invites to your Discord guild. This includes the guild invite code, the user who created the invite, and the specific channel it targets. This information is used to post messages in your chosen guild staff channel when a new member joins your guild. These messages will provide important information, such as who invited the user, the user's account creation date, and other relevant details to assist with user onboarding and management.

We understand the importance of your privacy, and we want to assure you that this information will be used solely for the purpose of enhancing your guild's management and user onboarding experience.
